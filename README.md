**Capsula** library lets you build JavaScript applications using highly reusable, flexible, and encapsulated software components called "capsules". With Capsula you can:

- create your application out of **encapsulated components** - capsules.
- have **multi-level architectural views** of your application.
- be **both declarative and imperative** having the best of both worlds. Artifacts developed either way speak the same language and could seamlessly be combined and used together.
- **increase flexibility** of your UI components by managing layout and behavior in quite a unique way.
- **handle asynchronous communication** focusing only on what's essential.
- exploit **really fast dev cycle** of plain JavaScript; no transpiling in the process.
